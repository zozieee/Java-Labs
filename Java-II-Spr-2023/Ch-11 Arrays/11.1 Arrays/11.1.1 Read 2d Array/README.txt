Write a function to read values of a number of rows, number of columns, 2 dimensional (2D) array elements and display the 2D array in a matrix form.

Input
2
3
1 4 5
2 3 0

Where,
• First line of represents the number of rows.
• Second line of input represents the number of columns.
• Third line contains array elements of the 1st row and so on.

Output
1 4 5
2 3 0

where
• There must be single space between 2 numbers in the row.
• There should not be any space after the last number in the row.
e.g. in the 2nd row, there should not be any space after number
0.

Assume that,
• Row and column values are integers within the range [1 to 100].
• 2D Array elements are within the range [-2147483648 to 2147483647].
